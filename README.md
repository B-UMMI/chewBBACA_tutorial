## Objective
The objective of this tutorial is to illustrate the complete workflow of a chewBBACA pipeline for creating a wgMLST and a cgMLST schema for a colection of 714 _Streptococcus agalactiae_ genomes (32 complete genomes and 682 assemblies deposited on the Sequence Read Archive) by providing step-by-step instructions and displaying the obtained outputs.

All information about NCBI genomes used in this example is on the [.tsv file](https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA_tutorial/tree/master/genomes/NCBI_genomes_proks.Sagalactiae_allGenomes.2016_08_03.tsv).
 inside the `genomes` folder.

The setup is done by the following steps   
1. do a `git clone https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA_tutorial` to download the entire repository in the folder of your choice
2. `cd chewBBACA_tutorial/` to enter the dir
3. `unzip genomes/complete_genomes.zip` to extract all the complete genomes files. a directory named complete_genomes will be available at `chewBBACA tutorial/`

The reported times using the 32 complete genomes were calculated for a Dual QuadCore laptop with  intel i7 2.4GHz using 6 cores. Using slower machines or using less number of CPUs can greatly increase the duration of the analyses.


## Schema creation

The wgMLST schema was created using the **32** _Streptococcus agalactiae_ complete genomes (32 genomes with a level of assembly classified as complete genome or chromossome)  available at NCBI.
The sequences are present in the `complete_genomes/` folder. The command is the following:  

`chewBBACA.py CreateSchema -i complete_genomes/ --cpu 6 -o schema_seed -t "Streptococcus agalactiae"`

The command uses 6 CPU and outputs the schema to `schema_seed` folder using the `prodigal` training set for _Streptococcus agalactiae_ and took around 16 minutes to complete resulting on a wgMLST schema wiht 3129 loci.
At this point the schema is defined as a set of loci each with a single allele.

## Allele calling
The next step was to perform allele calling with the created wgMLST schema for the **32** complete genomes.

`chewBBACA.py AlleleCall -i complete_genomes/ -g schema_seed/ -o results_cg --cpu 6 -t "Streptococcus agalactiae"`

The allele call used the default BSR threshold of 0.6 (more information on the thresold [here](https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA/wiki/2.-Allele-Calling)) and took approximately 22 mins to complete (an average of 41 secs per genome)  

## Paralog detection

The next step in the analysis is to determine if some of the loci can be considered paralogs, based on the result of the wgMLST allele calling. The _Allele call_ returns a list of Paralogous genes in the `RepeatedLoci.txt` file that can be found on the `results_cg` folder.
The output example is present in `chewBBACA_tutorial/results_cg/results_20170809T100937/`. In `chewBBACA_tutorial/results_cg/results_20170809T100937/RepeatedLoci.txt`, a set of 24 loci were identified as possible paralogs
that were removed from further analysis. For a more detailed description see the [Alelle Calling](https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA/wiki/2.-Allele-Calling) entry on the wiki.


`chewBBACA.py RemoveGenes -i results_alleles.tsv -g RepeatedLoci.txt -o alleleCallMatrix_cg`

A set of **1133** loci were found to be present in all the analyzed complete genomes, while **1264** loci were present in at least 95%.

`chewBBACA.py TestGenomeQuality -i alleleCallMatrix_cg.tsv -n 13 -t 200 -s 5`

For further analysis only the **1264** loci that we chose to represent the cgMLST schema will be used. The list can be retrieved from the `analysis_cg/Genes_95%.txt` that TestGenomeQuality creates.
There you can find the list of loci present in 95% of the strains per threshold, in this case we will use any threshold from 60 to 195 since the number of loci . You can see the list file with **1264** loci at `analysis_cg/listgenes_core.txt` and for further use you should add for each loci the full path for each locus fasta file.

## Allele call for 682 _Streptococci agalactiae_ assemblies

**682 assemblies** of _Streptococcus agalactiae_ available on NCBI were downloaded ( 03-08-2016, downloadable zip file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw6VuoagsdhmaWEtR25fODlJTEk/view?usp=sharing))
and analyzed with [MLST](https://github.com/tseemann/mlst) in order to exclude possibly mislabeled samples as _Streptococcus agalactiae_.

Out of the **682 genomes**, 2 (GCA_000323065.2_ASM32306v2 and GCA_001017915.1_ASM101791v1) were detected as being of a different species/contamination and removed from the analysis.
Allele call was performed on the bona fide  _Streptococcus agalactiae_ **680 genomes** using the **1264 loci** for schema validation. Paralog detection found no paralog loci.

`chewBBACA.py AlleleCall -i .genomes/ -g listgenes_core.txt -o results --cpu 20 -t "Streptococcus agalactiae"`

Run on a slurm based HPC with 20 cpu took approximately 45 mins to complete (an average of 4 secs per genome)

Since our initial 32 genomes allele call was performed with the wgMLST schema we need to remove the loci that constitute the auxiliary genome, in order to be able to compare with the cgMLST allele call we performed for the 680 genomes.  We select the `alleleCallMatrix_cg.tsv` file we previously created (already paralog free but still a wgMLST profile) and we extract only the loci present in 95% of the matrix.

`chewBBACA.py ExtractCgMLST -i alleleCallMatrix_cg.tsv -o cgMLST_completegenomes -p 0.95`

Now the file `cgMLST_completegenomes/cgMLST.tsv` can be concatenated with the allele call result from the 680 genomes `results_all/results_20170809T110653/results_alleles.tsv`. The concatenated file can be found at `analysis_all/cgMLST_all.tsv`.

The new concatenated file was analyzed in order to assess the cgMLST allele quality attribution for all the genomes.

`chewBBACA.py TestGenomeQuality -i cgMLST_all.tsv -n 13 -t 300 -s 5`

While the number of loci present in 95% of genomes remains virtually constant at around **1200** loci, considering all
or most of the genomes (90%<xâ‰¤100%) the number of loci present is lower and presents some variation when specific genomes are removed from the analysis.

We selected the results at the threshold of 25 for further analysis. Although this selection is somewhat arbitrary, when moving to a lower threshold there is step increase in the number of loci present in 95% and 99% of genomes that could represent the exclusion of a more divergent clade from the analysis. Furthermore, at the threshold of 25 there is an acceptable number of loci present in all considered genomes (651 genomes/435 loci), which we felt would afford a good discriminatory power.

The genomes that were removed at each threshold are indicated in the file `analysis_all/removedGenomes.txt` and a file `analysis_all/removedGenomes_25.txt` was created with only the genomes removed at the 25 threshold.

The following command creates a directory `analysis_all/cgMLST_25/` and saves the cgMLST schema selected at the chosen threshold to the file `cgMLST.tsv`.

`chewBBACA.py ExtractCgMLST -i cgMLST_all.tsv -o cgMLST_25 -g removedGenomes_25.txt`

## Minimum Spanning Tree
`analysis_all/cgMLST_25/cgMLST.tsv` was uploaded to [Phyloviz online](https://online.phyloviz.net) and can be accessed [here](https://online.phyloviz.net/main/dataset/share/cfab1610a3ca3a80cf9c139e436ce741fc5fa29dcc5aeb3988025491d4434143fc72f6284aaff7d60c6a2ae5e19f57d6be3e5e0aaf369a7e37d5ecef6f1d746b8a7fee5882f4a65a586967be0146)


## Genome Quality analysis
Since the quality of the used assemblies was not confirmed, it is possible that some of the assemblies
included were of low quality. A general analysis of the assemblies show a N50
variation that ranges from 8055 to over 2.2M, while the number of contigs ranges between
1 and 553. These results made us suspect that the quality of the
genomes could have affected the allele call results and consequently caused a significant drop in the number of loci detected as present in all genomes.  

As stated previously, to obtain the cgMLST schema,
some genomes (n=62) had to be removed since they were extremes cases of missing data.
In order to assess the possible reason for their poor allele call performance, two plots
were built. The removed genomes were then highlighted and dashed lines were drawn linking the values for the same genomes.

The first plot represents the total number of bp in contigs with a size >10 kbp and the N50 of the assemblies, sorted by decreasing values.

The second plot represents the total number of contigs and the number of
contigs >10 kbp

[See interactive plot online](http://im.fm.ul.pt/chewBBACA/GenomeQual/AssemblyStatsStack.html)

At first sight, most of the removed genomes (57/61) were located on the lower range of
N50 and bp in contigs >10 kbp (fig.3) and the higher number of contigs (fig.4)

The 5 genomes that were outside this pattern were individually checked :

1. **GCA_000186445.1** [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000186445.1) - 21 contigs but only 1 is above 10k (Scaffold with lot of Ns, 134 real contigs)
2. **GCA_000221325.2** [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000221325.2)- NCBI curated it out of RefSeq because it had a genome length too large
3. **GCA_000427055.1** [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000427055.1)- NCBI curated it out of RefSeq because it had many frameshifted proteins
4. **GCA_000289455.1** [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000289455.1)- No ST found. We concluded the assembly has a problem but we have not yet identified it.
5. **GCA_000288835.1** [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000288835.1)- NCBI curated it out of RefSeq because it had many frameshifted proteins


## Schema Evaluation
Schema Evaluator was run on the cgMLST schema:

`chewBBACA.py SchemaEvaluator -i schema_seed/ -l rms/RmS.html -ta 11 --title "cgMLST schema GBS tutorial schema evaluator" --cpu 6`
